# For extensions we require a max version that is compatible across security releases.
# FIREFOX_MAXVERSION and SEAMONKEY_MAXVERSION is our method for doing that.
# Alpha versions 10.0a1 and 10.0a2 aren't affected
# For Seamonkey, 2.17 becomes 2.17.*, 2.17.1 becomes 2.17.*
# For Firefox, 10.0 becomes 10.*, 10.0.1 becomes 10.*
